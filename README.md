## UX 
The UX section outlines the design process, planning, and reasoning behind the Nokia E72 documentation website, focusing on user needs, accessibility and project goals.

### Developer and Business Goals
The main objectives of this project from both developer and user perspectives include:

1.	Preserve and share knowledge: Create a reliable resource about the Nokia E72, including its specs, manuals, and visuals.
2.	Build engagement: Allow visitors to reach out with questions or contributions via a contact form.
3.	Accessibility: Present content in a clear, simple layout that works well on desktop and mobile.
4.	SEO value: Attract visitors searching for Nokia E72 documentation, history, or nostalgia content.

### User Stories
**Homepage** (description + gallery)
- As a nostalgic phone enthusiast, I want to read a short description of the Nokia E72, so I can quickly understand its history and importance.
- As a visitor, I want to view a gallery of high-quality photos, so I can see the design details of the device.

**Documentation subpage** (manuals + specs table)
- As a user who owns a Nokia E72, I want to download the user manual, so I can learn how to operate the phone.
- As a repair technician or hobbyist, I want to access the service manual, so I can understand repair procedures.
- As a researcher or collector, I want to view a clear technical specifications table, so I can compare the E72 with other phones.

**Contact subpage** (form)
- As a visitor, I want to use a simple contact form, so I can ask for help troubleshooting the device.

### Design Choices

**Colour Scheme**
The chosen palette creates a balance between professionalism and nostalgia, reflecting the Nokia brand’s corporate heritage while keeping the design clean and readable.

| Element | Purpose  | Colour | Hex Code | Preview |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Text    | High-contrast readability| Very dark grey | #051122 | <span style="background-color:#051122; display:inline-block; width:20px; height:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></span>|
| Headings | Purple highlights and modern touch | Purple | #63036A | <span style="background-color:#63036A; display:inline-block; width:20px; height:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></span> |
| Background | Clarity and focus on content | White | #FFFFFF | <span style="background-color:#FFFFFF; display:inline-block; width:20px; height:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></span> |
| Buttons, URLs | Accent freshness and visual hierarchy | Teal | #06C6B5 | <span style="background-color:#06C6B5; display:inline-block; width:20px; height:20px; border:1px solid #ccc;"></span> |


**Fonts** 

The system font stack:
```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; 
```
was selected for accessibility, legibility, and performance. It uses native system fonts to ensure fast loading times, consistent appearance across devices, and a clean, professional aesthetic suitable for a documentation-style site.

**Icons**
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used for social media links. They provide a visually intuitive way to recognise platforms and actions, while maintaining scalability and accessibility through proper ARIA labels.

**Styling**
The overall styling approach follows modern documentation design principles — a minimalist layout, generous white space and a consistent grid system using Bootstrap 5. This ensures the site remains easy to navigate, fully responsive and visually aligned with the structured nature of technical documentation.

### Wireframes
The wireframes were created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) during the planning and design stage of the project.
